Stable Matching

Goal: Given a set of preferences among hospitals and studetns, design a self-reinforcing admissions process

Unstable pairs: Hospital h and student h form an unstable pair if both:
> h prefers s to one of its admitted students
> s s prefers h to assigned hospital


Stable assignment: Assignment with no unstable pairs
> Natural and desirable condition
> Individual self-interest prevents any hospital-student side deal.
